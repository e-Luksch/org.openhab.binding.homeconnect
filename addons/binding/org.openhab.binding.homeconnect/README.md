# HomeConnect Binding

The binding integrates the [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) system into openHAB.
It uses the Home Connect API to connect to household devices (Bosch and Siemens). 

As all status updates and commands have to go through the API, a permanent internet connection is required.

Supported devices: dishwasher, washer, dryer, oven, refrigerator/freezer, coffee machine

## Supported Things

### Bridge

The __Home Connect API__ is responsible for the communication with the Home Connect API. All devices use this bridge to execute commands and listen for updates. Without a working bridge the devices cannot communicate.

### Devices

Currently dishwashers, washing machines, dryers, refrigerators/freezers, coffee machines and ovens are supported.

## Discovery

After the bridge has been added, devices are discovered automatically.


## Channels

| Channel Type ID | Item Type    | Read only | Description  | Available on thing |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| power_state | Switch | false | This setting describes the current power state of the home appliance. | dishwasher | 
| power_state_read_only | true | Switch | This setting describes the current power state of the home appliance (read only). | oven | 
| door_state | Contact | true | This status describes the state of the door of the home appliance.

| super_mode_refrigerator | Switch | true | The setting has no impact on setpoint temperatures but will make the fridge compartment cool to the lowest possible temperature until it is disabled by the manually by the customer or by the HA because of a timeout. | refrigerator/freezer | 
| super_mode_freezer | Switch | true | This setting has no impact on setpoint temperatures but will make the freezer compartment cool to the lowest possible temperature until it is disabled by the manually by the customer or by the home appliance because of a timeout. | refrigerator/freezer | 
            
## Thing Configuration

### Configuring the __Home Connect API__ Bridge


#### Physical appliance

##### 1. Preconditions

1. Please create an account at [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) and add your physical appliance to your account.
2. Test the connection to your physical appliance via mobile app ([Apple App Store (iOS) ](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/home-connect-app/id901397789?mt=8) or [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bshg.homeconnect.android.release)).

##### 2. Create oAuth2 tokens (Device Flow)

1. Create an account at [https://developer.home-connect.com](https://developer.home-connect.com) and login.
2. Create an application at [https://developer.home-connect.com/applications](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications)
    * _Application ID_: e.g. `openhab-binding`
    * _OAuth Flow_: Device Flow
    * _Home Connect User Account for Testing_: the associated user account email from [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) **_Please don't use your developer account username_**
3. Now you should see the client id and secret of the application. Please save them for later.
4. Use `curl` or equivalent method to start the authorization. Please replace `[client id]` with your application client id.

Curl call:

```
curl -X POST \
  https://api.home-connect.com/security/oauth/device_authorization \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'client_id=[client id]&scope=IdentifyAppliance%20Monitor%20Settings'
```

Response:

```
{
    "expires_in": 300,
    "device_code": "xxxxx-yyy-44fa-ff5-5b82c6348",
    "user_code": "0123-4567",
    "verification_uri": "https://verify.home-connect.com",
    "interval": 5,
    "verification_uri_complete": "https://verify.home-connect.com?user_code=0123-4567"
}
```

Please save the `device_code` and the `verification_uri_complete` for later use.

5. Open the `verification_uri_complete` link in a web browser. You can now login with your [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) account and grant access. **_Please don't use your developer account credentials**
6. Use `curl` or equivalent method to get the oAuth token. Please replace `[client id]` and `[client secret]` with your application credentials. For `[device code]` use response data from step 4. 

Curl call:

```
curl -X POST \
  https://api.home-connect.com/security/oauth/token \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'client_id=[client id]&client_secret=[client secret]&grant_type=device_code&device_code=[device code]'
```

Response:

```
{
    "id_token": "xyz",
    "access_token": "abc",
    "expires_in": 86400,
    "scope": "IdentifyAppliance Monitor Settings",
    "refresh_token": "123456",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Please save `refresh_token` for later use in Paper UI. According to the API documentation the token expires if it wasn't used within 2 months. These means once setup, the configuration should work without recreating tokens manually.

##### 3. Setup Paper UI

The Home Connect bridge can be configured in the Paper UI as follows:

1. Go to Inbox > Choose Binding and add a new "HomeConnect Binding".
2. Enter
    * __client id:__ your application client id
    * __client secret:__ your application client secret
    * __simulator:__ false
    * __refresh token:__ token from previous step
3. That's it! Now you can use autodiscovery to add devices.

#### Simulator

The Home Connect developer site allows you to use simulated appliances. You can control them at https://developer.home-connect.com/simulator/dishwasher.

1. Create an account at [https://developer.home-connect.com](https://developer.home-connect.com) and login.
2. Open [https://developer.home-connect.com/applications](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications) and save the client id from the default application: "API Web Client" for later use.
3. Setup bridge at Paper UI
    1. Go to Inbox > Choose Binding and add a new "HomeConnect Binding".
    2. Enter
        * __client id:__ id from 2. step
        * __client secret:__ leave blank
        * __simulator:__ true
        * __refresh token:__ leave blank
    3. That's it! Now you can use autodiscovery to add devices.
